UATG Configuration Files
########################

UATG makes use of 4 configuration files for the currently existing tests. In 
addition to that, it takes in 2 more YAML files which will be used for future 
tests.

  1. ``config.ini`` - UATG Configuration file.
  2. ``isa_config.yaml`` - ISA Configuration file for ISA based test filtering.
  3. ``core_config.yaml`` - Core Configuration file specifying the micro
     architectural choices.
  4. ``custon_config.yaml`` - Custom configuration file.
  5. ``csr_grouping.yaml`` - Contains information about the CSRs required in the
     implementation.
  6. ``aliasing.yaml`` - File with alias for verilog signal names. (used
     when generating covergroups)

When specified, UATG also generates a ``test_list.yaml`` file along with the tests.

In this document, we try to explain the need to have these files as well throw 
some light on the format of these documents, so that the user can write/edit the
configuration file, as necessary. 

In order to provide a headstart, the ``uatg setup`` command will generate 
template ``config.ini``, ``dut_config.yaml`` and ``aliasing.yaml`` files.

============================
``config.ini`` Specification
============================

The ``config.ini`` file is used to specify the arguments required by UATG to 
generate tests. The user may choose to use the subcommands to manually perform 
the same tasks and decide to not use a ``config.ini`` file.

Configuration Options
---------------------

.. note:: Information about the ``*_config.yaml``, ``csr_grouping.yaml``, 
   ``aliasing.yaml`` and ``test_list.yaml`` are provided in the following 
   sections.

.. warning:: All paths are absolute.

=======================================
DUT Configuration YAML(s) Specification
=======================================

The ``isa_config.yaml``, ``core_config.yaml``, ``custom_config.yaml``, and 
``csr_grouping.yaml`` files are the configuration files used to configure the 
DUT. These files should contain information about the hardware units present in 
the DUT as well as provide information about the ISA and off-core components 
like cache supported/present in the unit.

Usually such yaml files is used to generate a core of required configuration 
from an existing, highly parameterizable base design. In the case of ``Chromite``
, we have 4 configuration ``yaml`` files. We we use these files to selectively 
generate tests based on the hardware units present in the DUT.

This ``***_config.yaml`` files will be used by the test classes as well as the 
test generator to identify tests that can suitably exercise all the hardware
implemented in the design as well as parameterize the test to exploit the 
hardware features to the fullest.

.. warning:: It is paramount that the users who use their custom 
   ``*_config.yaml`` and ``csr_grouping.yaml`` files make sure that their first 
   YAML file contains the ``ISA`` supported by the DUT as a parameter. 
   If not, UATG **will throw an error and exit**.

If you notice, this yaml file contains information like the bus_protocol, isb
size, cache parameters and several others. 

To explain how we use these parameters in UATG, let us consider the 
``branch_predictor`` key of the yaml file.

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|

.. table:: Parameters in Branch Predictor 

  =================== =========================================================
  Parameter           Description
  =================== =========================================================
  instantiate         indicates if the branch predictor (BPU) is present in the 
                      core
  predictor           denotes the type of predictor implemented
  on_reset            denotes if the BPU will be enabled after resetting the core
  btb_depth           depth of the Branch target Buffer(BTB) in the gshare BPU
  bht_depth           depth of the Branch History Table(BHT) in the gshare BPU 
  history_len         width of the Global History Register(GHR).
  history_bits        bits of the Global History Register which is actually used
                      for predicting based on history.
  ras_depth           depth of the Return Address Stack used for storing return
                      address of Call statements
  =================== =========================================================

Similar to this, you can find the configuration of other similar units present 
in the core from the ``core_config.yaml`` file. The paramters obtained from the
section like branch predictor will be particularly useful when tests are to be 
targeted.

The following snippet shows how the parameters of the branch predictor from the 
config file will be used to create a targeted test for exercising the BPU.

.. note:: UATG will internally combine the four YAML files into a nested 
   dictionary. Then we only pass the required module section of the 
   ``core_config.yaml`` file with the ISA string.  

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def execute(self, _dut_dict):
        _en_bpu = _bpu_dict['instantiate']
        self._btb_depth = _bpu_dict['btb_depth']
        if _en_bpu and self._btb_depth:
            return True
        else:
            return False

The snippet above is from the test class which tries to fill the entire Branch
Target Buffer (BTB) of a branch predictor unit (G-Share Fully Associative) with
jump, call, return and conditional branch instructions.

.. note:: The _dut_dict argument shown here contains only the values associated
   with the ``branch_predictor`` key from the yaml file shown earlier. The
   UATG-test_generator will send only the values present in the key which matches 
   the module for which said test was written for.

Here, the *execute()* method reads the value of ``instantiate`` in the bpu 
section of the ``dut_config.yaml`` into the ``_en_bpu`` variable. It also stores 
the depth of the ``BTB`` in the variable ``_btb_depth``. As this test is meant
to exercise the BPU, there is no point to generate the test if the BPU is not 
instantiated. Likewise, it is necessary that the *btb_depth* is greater than one.
Hence, we use these conditions to decide if the test which we have in the test_class
would prove worthwhile when run on our DUT.

Therefore, it is necessary that the user creates a similiar yaml file as shown 
earlier and update it with their DUT's configuration to make targeted test 
generation easier.

===============================
``aliasing.yaml`` Specification
===============================

The aliasing file is neccesary when the user wants to generate Covergroups
(CocoTb or SV) along with the tests. The aliasing file tries to make the 
test_class more readable. 

The Verilog generated by the BSV compiler tends to be incomprehensible and long
some times. In this case, having a alias file which can be used to alias such 
incomprehensible signal names with intelligible and logical names will make the
process of defining the ``generate_covergroups()`` method easier as well as make 
the method readable for other people who do not know the actual BSV signal names.

The block above shows a sample aliasing file which has the signals in the 
``branch_predictor(bpu)`` aliased. In addition to that, we also have the 
hierarchical paths to the modules to be used in the top module of the test bench
defined here. Most of the times, the names generated by the BSV complier is 
very intelligible as shown in the above example. But, aliasing the signal names 
would make the process of writing/understanding code much easier.

As shown, the *input*, *output*, *register* and *wire* present in the module need
to be separately organized in the yaml file. This makes selection of files even
more easier as we do not have to indicate if the signal type in the aliased name
for readability.


================================
``test_list.yaml`` Specification
================================

When gen_test_list is true in the ``config.ini`` or when ``-t`` is passed 
with the ``uatg generate`` command, UATG, apart from generating just the
test artifacts, must also generate a test list YAML. The test list has the
following syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

   <test-name>:
    asm_file: <path to assembly/C/test file generated>
    cc: <optional compile command to be used to compile the tests>
    ccargs: <optional compile arguments to be used>
    extra_compile: [<list of supplementary files to be compiled. Provided as absolute paths>]
    include: [<list of directories containing any required header file>]
    isa: <the isa string for which this test was generated for>
    linker_args: <arguments to be provided to the linker command>
    linker_file: <absolute path of the linker file to be used>
    result: <set to Unvailable during generation. Will change to Pass or Fail based on the simulation runs>
    generator: <name of the generator plugin used to generate this test>
    march: <the march argument to be supplied to the compiler>
    mabi: <the mabi argument to be supplied to the compiler>
    compile_macros: <list of strings indicating compile time macros that need to be enabled>

.. note:: While we capture the ISA, it may seem redundant to capture the march
   and mabi. However, the tests can be generated to check a subset features like
   - no compressed instructions in targets which do support compressed
   instructions. Hence the redundancy. 

.. note:: cc and ccargs are optional here because typically the target/DUT will
   have its own compiler and toolchain setup and may ignore these fields. Also
   most of the test generators are independent of the choice of toolchain and
   may leave these fields blank.

.. warning:: All the files contain an *absolute* path.
