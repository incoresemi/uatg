===============================================
List of known issues with Gshare FA BPU Testing
===============================================

Open issues
===========
- The hashing function is not easily predictable, hence it is not possible to
  create tests which require the BHT index to be fixed, say predict-mispredict
  test. 
  Tests dependent on this issue
  -----------------------------
  * **Predict-Mispredict test:** This test predicts a branch to be taken and not 
    taken correctly. Currently, the BPU gets trained to predict taken correctly, 
    but when attempting to correctly predict a not taken, the BHT index changes.
    This makes the BPU predict not taken, which is correct, but this is not what
    we require for the test to pass.
  * **Cheking if 'ALL' BHT entries are updated properly:** This test checks if all
    the BHT entries get updated properly (as shown in the FSM). Currently, the 
    intractability of the BHT updation makes it difficult to perform this test.
