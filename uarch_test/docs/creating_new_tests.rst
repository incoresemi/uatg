Micro-Arch-Test Framework
=========================

Framework Structure
-------------------

The framework is structured in the following manner.

-  New folders are to be created for each block that needs to be tested
   (e.g. ``bpu/``).
-  Within each block's folder, a ``tests/`` folder is created to store
   the generated assembly codes. In addition, the python scripts to
   automate the assembly file generation are stored in the block's
   folder.
-  For automating the test generating process, we are using ``yapsy``
   module which needs a plugin file (e.g. ``test_no_1.yapsy-plugin``)
   created for each python script. To avoid hassle, we have automated
   the process of creating the plugin files too. The plugin files are
   created when ``test_generator.py`` is called. The plugin files are
   ignored by git.
-  The ``test-generator.py`` script parses through all the tests defined
   in the block folder and chooses specific tests based on their
   applicability (more about this in the ``Adding new tests`` section).
-  For each chosen test case, the script creates new folders with the
   test name inside the ``tests/`` folder and writes assembly files into
   each of the respective folders.

Generating and Executing tests on `RiVer Core <https://github.com/incoresemi/river_core>`__
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the required python packages. This can be done by running the
command

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt

If required, the user can replace the ``dut_config.yaml`` file with the
configuration file of their DUT in the ``micro-arch-test/target/``
directory. The test generator looks for a ``dut_config.yaml`` in the
directory.

Now, To run the tests on RiVer Core, it is necessary that the user
creates a ``path.txt`` file in this directory
(``micro-arch-tests/framework``).

The first line of the ``path.txt`` file should be the path to the
working directory of RiVer Core. This directory would have been created
by the user while setting up RiVerCore. This directory contains the
``river_core.ini`` file and the the ``mywork`` directory. More
information of how to set up RiVer Core can be found
`here <https://river-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`__

Once the ``path.txt`` file is updated with the correct path to the
working directory of RiVer Core, the tests can be generated and executed
on RiVer Core using the command

.. code:: shell

    python test_generator.py

This will generate the Assembly programs, invoke RiVer Core, run the
tests on the preferred DUT, compare the results with the reference, and
finally generate a report stating if the tests passed or not.

In addition to RiVer Core, we also parse the log generated from the DUT
using regular expressions to check if the log contains a minimal
expression which should be present if the test was executed properly. It
is necessary that the RiVer core's DUT plugin is suitably modified to
dump the log. (By default no log is dumped by RiVer core)

This result from parsing the log is also displayed.

Adding new tests
----------------

Before adding new test cases to the framework, one needs to understand
the conventions that are followed to ensure code compatibility and
automation.

Note : The ``execute``,\ ``generate_asm`` and ``check_log`` functions'
implementation are **mandatory**. The default return values are as
follows, ``execute``:``False``, ``generate_asm``:``''``,
``check_log``:``None``.

1. Packages Imported by the test\_generator

   1. Yapsy: for plugin management (version>=1.12.2)
   2. regex\_formats: file containing regex expressions for commonly
      used log patterns ()
   3. re: python regular expression library

2. Creating a class with same name as that of the test\_name and
   initializing with default parameters that is needed for generating
   the assembly program.

3. Defining the ``execute`` function:

   1. This function returns if the current DUT configuration has the
      necessary hardware implemented for this(new test to be added) test
      to be run on.
   2. Obtain the requisite parameters from the DUT configuration yaml
      file and check if the test should be generated. An example
      parameter could be 'btbdepth' in the case of a 'gshare BPU'. It is
      recommended that the user checks if the hardware unit would be
      **instantiated** before moving on to other cases.
   3. If the requisite hardware is implemented return ``True`` else
      return ``False``

4. Defining the ``generate_asm`` function:

   -  This function should return a formatted string. This string will
      be directly written as the assembly test program.

5. Defining the ``check_log`` function:

   1. Read the log file from ``log_file_path`` variable.
   2. Using the regex patterns given from the ``regex_formats.py`` file,
      and ``re`` module, parse the log file.
   3. Create conditions that test for successful execution and fail
      cases.
   4. If the assembly test passes, return ``True`` else return
      ``False``.

6. If the ``regex-formats.py`` file does not have suitable regex
   patterns, frame the regex pattern and store it in the file with
   suitable naming.

A generic test ``test_name.py`` is written in this manner. This test
uses the parameters from the Chromite's default configuration. We write
a test for the BPU here. The user should modify this test accordingly to
suite their needs.
